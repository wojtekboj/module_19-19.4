## General info
Separation of reducer for comments

The file reducers.js has been redesigned, and then the comments reducers have been imported, which will be in a 
separate comments.js file. For now, do not worry about reducedcer users.js. We have not yet created any actions 
that described changes in users, so there is no need to create a reducer for this state.
